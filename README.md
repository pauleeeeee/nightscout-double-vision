Nightscout Double Vision is a Pebble watchface that allows you to track blood sugar data from two Nightscout URLs. The watchface shows blood sugar levels, most recent level change (delta), insulin on board (IOB), and battery percentage. Also included are the time, a bluetooth indicator, and your Pebble's battery indicator.

Visit the settings page to configure alerts and other options.

Tap on the glass of your Pebble until the Pebble vibrates. Graph data will be fetched and displayed for 15 seconds.
